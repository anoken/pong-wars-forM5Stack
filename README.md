# pong-wars_for_M5Stack

This software is a modification of Mr. vnglst's pong-wars and modified to work with M5StackCore2.
Pong-wars is fun just to watch. It has a high affinity with M5Stack, and it is very interesting just to display it.

I created the base using this as a reference.This software is developed using JavaScript.
